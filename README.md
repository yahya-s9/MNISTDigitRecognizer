Summary Abstract: This past winter break, I decided to explore machine learning (ML). After completing a ML w/ Python bootcamp from Udemy, I was prepared to undertake my first technical project with Tensorflow: Implementing an artificial neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data set. This is common for beginners to ML. A final accuracy of 96% was reported.
